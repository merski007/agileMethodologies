What is Agile: Team based, small task methodolgy. Quickly process tasks in 2 week sprints. Finish product/component after each sprint. Constant feedback from enduser/business

What it is not: Large scale, highly detailed methodology. Rigid in the terms for step 2 is after step 3 and so forth. Any task can be worked on. tasks are not dependent on other task completion.
