Waterfall steps:
- Requirements
- Analysis, scope
- Design, logical/physical
- Coding
- Testing, QA, test plan
- Deployment, R&DM (release and deployment management)
- Maintenance/Operations

# System Analysis Terms #
- Methodologies, a sequence of step-by-step approaches that help develop the information system
- Waterfall (SDLC), classic approach to the systems develoment life cycle; describes a development method that is linear and sequential; project outcome and plan must be set in the beginning
- System, An interrelated set of procedures used within one business unit working together for a purpose
- Systems Analyst
    - studies an organization's current computer systems and procedures, and design solutions to hlep the organization perate more efficiently and effectivly
    - they bring business and informatnion technology together by understanding the needs and limitations of both
    - understanding of organization's objectives, structure and processes
- Systems Development Team
    - studies problems and needs of an organization
    - determines best approach to improving organization through use of:
        - people
        - methods
        - processes
        - information technology
    - help system users and managers define their requirements
- Stakeholder
    - someone/anyone who is affected by the system being developed
    - users and customers
    - business analyst, designer, coder, tester...
    - domain expert, author of documentation
    - maintenance, support desk
- Information System Components
    - hardware and sytem software
    - documentation and training materials
    - job roles associated with the system
    - controls to prevent theft or fraud
    - the people who use the software to perform their jobs
- Decomposition, the process of breaking down a system into smaller components
    - allows the systems analyst to:
        - break a system into small, manageable and understandable subsytems
        - focus on one area at a time, without interference from other areas
        - build different components at independent times and have the help of different analysts
- Modularity, process of dividing a system into modules of realtively uniform size
- Coupling, subsystems that are dependent upon each other are coupled
- Cohesion, extent to which a subsystem performs a single function
- Deliverable, a product produced as part of a project, such as hardware or software, planning documents, or meeting minutes
- Project Scope
    - defines and controls what is or is not included in a project
    - all the work involved in creating the products of the project
    - prepared for internal and external stakeholders
- Project scope statement should include:
    - business need / executive summary
    - scope / goal / purpose
    - requirements definition
    - project solution / description
    - stakeholders
    - cost / schedule / feasibility
    - benefits
    - overall recommendation
- Requirements Determiniation
    - to transform the system request's high-level statement of business requirements into a more detail, precise list of what the new system must do to provide the needed value to the business
- Requirements, a requirement is simply a statement of what the system must do or what characteristics it needs to have
    - business requirements, describe what the business needs
    - user requirements, what the users need it to do
    - functional requirements, what the software should do
    - nonfunctional requirements, characters the system should have (quality, design, performance, external interfaces, operational, security, cultural)
